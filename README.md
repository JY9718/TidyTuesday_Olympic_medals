# TidyTuesday_Olympic_medals_China

This is a weekly challenge taken from TidyTuesday 2021-07-27 https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/readme.md

The dataset contains records of all Olympic participants from 1896 to 2016

I have focused on Chinese athletes' performance in the Summer Olympics from 1984 to 2016 (9 Olympic games), and mainly discussed the performance in each gender group.

Gender inequality is a heated topic in China, this analysis is actually inspired by recent news of Alibaba sexual harrassment case https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-08/alibaba-manager-accused-of-sexual-assault-to-be-fired-memo and Kris Wu rape accusation https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/02/china/kris-wu-detained-rape-intl-hnk/index.html in China

Females in China (and in the whole world) are still facing a lot of inequalities / discriminations in families,schools and workplaces, hence, how to promote gender equality remains a significant topic for society.

 This analysis has plotted various charts to show the number of athletes, number of medals and medal rate in 9 Olympics games from 1984 to 2016, grouped by gender. 

We could see that Chinese female athletes have won more medals than male in all 9 Olympic games and the number of female participants increases steadily over the years. 

The medal rate (number of medals/number of participants) among female athletes is higher than males in 8 out of 9 Olympics games.

Hope this could be an encouragement to me (and all my sisters fighting against gender descrimination): our fight is meaningful!
